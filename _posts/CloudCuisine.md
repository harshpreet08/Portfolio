# Project Overview

CloudCuisine is a full-stack cloud-based recipe-sharing application built using AWS. It allows users to create, share, and discover recipes with real-time data synchronization and secure authentication.

### **Key Features:**

- **Containerized Deployment**: Deployed using Docker and AWS Lambda for serverless backend operations.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Optimized with AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure automation and MySQL (Aurora) for structured data storage.
