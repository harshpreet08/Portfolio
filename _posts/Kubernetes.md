# Project Overview

This project showcases a **Kubernetes-based deployment pipeline** for containerized applications. It integrates **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD** to ensure seamless application scaling and automated deployments.

### **Key Features:**

- **Container Orchestration**: Deployed microservices using Kubernetes with managed scaling.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Implemented Jenkins/GitHub Actions to automate deployments.
- **Load Balancing & Monitoring**: Configured Ingress controllers and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Hosted on AWS/GCP with Terraform for infrastructure as code.
